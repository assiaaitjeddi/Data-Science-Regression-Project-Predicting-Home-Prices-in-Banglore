# Bangalore House Price Prediction

## Context
Bangalore, nicknamed the Silicon Valley of India, is a vibrant tech hub known for its rapid growth and ever-changing real estate market. With the continuous influx of professionals looking to relocate to the city, the demand for housing has increased significantly, making Bangalore's real estate market one of the most active in India. In this context, the ability to accurately predict house prices in Bangalore can provide a significant advantage to real estate buyers, sellers, and investors.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices in Bangalore based on various characteristics such as total square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. This project aims to explore Bangalore's real estate data, perform data feature cleaning and engineering, and finally build and evaluate a regression model that can estimate the price of a house with reasonable accuracy.

## Methodology
1. **Data Mining and Cleaning:** Analysis of available data to understand trends, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data cleansing to ensure the quality and accuracy of predictions.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and creating new features that can better represent the factors influencing house prices in Bangalore.
3. **Model Construction:** Selection and training of regression models on cleaned and prepared data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Using appropriate metrics to evaluate model performance and selecting the best model for price prediction.

## Conclusion
This project aims not only to develop a predictive model but also to provide insights into the Bangalore real estate market, which can be valuable to various stakeholders. By applying data science and machine learning techniques, we aspire to demonstrate how technology can be used to make the real estate market more transparent and accessible.
